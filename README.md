This work demonstrates that mass falling into a black hole can never penetrate the event horizon as measured/observed from a coordinate space, due to the increasing space/time distortion while approaching the event horizon. The formation of a black hole can be simulated using masses without any volume and the distortion in space/time can be calculated at any point using the following algorithm:

Lambda = λ= 1−n2GMjj=1rjC2

A black hole created by the accumulation of mass first appears as a ‘point black hole’ withan rs ≈ 0. The passage of time has stopped at rs, and time is an integral component ofmotion. It follows that there could not have been any mass within rs originally, nor at anytime during the life of a black hole from the perspective of a coordinate space. A sphericalshell of point individual masses produces an isotropic lambda field and, to an observer within15the shell, is indistinguishable from any coordinate space. The event horizon represents a di-mensional collapse of a 4-dimensional (4D) space into a 3-dimensional (3D) space, where the
time dimension has completely collapsed and the Schwarzschild rs dimension becomes time-like. Because there is no mass within the event horizon, there is no need for there to be an‘Inside’ to the event horizon. The development of a 3D black hole in a 4D space summarizesthe development of the 4D space universe from a higher 5-dimensional (5D) space.
